# Snippet Saver

Simple little client-side web app that stores and loads data from local storage and lets you save and load files with snippets and markdown descriptions of the snippets.

To develop or run locally clone this repository master branch or download the zip and extract.  You'll need to install node/npm, bower & gulp, then in the extracted/cloned repository base folder run `npm install && bower install && gulp serve`
